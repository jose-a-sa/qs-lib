# qs-lib

`qs-lib` is my personal C++ library that provides various data structure implementations with a focus on low latency code. The library is designed to offer efficient and easy-to-use components for common programming tasks, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.
The primary goal of `qs-lib` is to serve as a collection of optimized data structures and utilities that can be reused across different projects.
It is built to support C++17 onwards (for now, will decide later making it compatible up to C++11), while making available nice features from other versions (e.g. std::span).


## Todo's

- Add fuzz-testing (need to find arm64 compatible alternatives)
- Add constexpr testing.
